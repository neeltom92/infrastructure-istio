refer :

```bash
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: nginx-virtual-svc
  namespace: learn
spec:
  hosts:
    - "nginxtest.dview.io"
  gateways:
    - dview/istio-external-gateway
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: nginx-service
            port:
              number: 80
      match:
        - uri:
            prefix: /

```
